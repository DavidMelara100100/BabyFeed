# Baby Feed Dev Guide
This document is meant to act as a quick guide for future development teams. 
Instructions will be provided for setting up the development environment as well as pushing to production.

## Setting Up the Dev Environment
Due to compilation issues on Windows and MacOS, the development for this project is done in Ubuntu. 
As such, for those with Windows and Mac devices it is recommended to use a VM to set up and work on the project over the course of the semester.

A couple of free options that have been used successfully by previous development teams include VMware and VirtualBox:

- [VMware installation guide](https://www.makeuseof.com/install-ubuntu-on-vmware-workstation/)
- [VirtualBox installation guide](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview)

> **Note**  
> When setting up your VM, be sure to enable settings that allow you to copy / paste between environments. This will save you a lot of time during installation.

Once your VM is set up and ready, follow the instructions provided [here](https://github.com/FIUPanther-JMolto98/BabyFeed-v10.0).

> **Warning**  
> You're very likely to run into issues during installation with MongoDB. Here are a couple of videos that might be helpful:

> - [Dealing with the "sudo" issue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZGHtuxpaP4)

As the installation guide suggests, it is highly recommended that you install the GitHub tool in VS Code to make committing your code easier.
